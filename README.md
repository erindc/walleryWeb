# walleryWeb

The web based gallery
------

Wallery provides artists with a focused channel to display and sell personal works of art.

walleryWeb is the UI for Wallery. It allows users to 'like' works of art, 'flag' them to be reviewed for removal, or purchase a work. Users can of course upload images through the UI as well. 

Users must create an account prior to accessing any of Wallery's features.
